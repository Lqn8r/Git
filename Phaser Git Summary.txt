Phaser CE is the community version of phaser where several hundred contributors can add or modify code. 
The community seems fairly big and most of the pull requests are handled by a couple of people according
to the information on the main page. All the pull requests that they do take are unconditional and so 
they will often take pull requests if they believe the changes are helpful for the community. The respository
contains a bunch of folders that have a bunch of tasks listed next to the folders. 
There is also a changelog and other text files to help keep track of the changes.
